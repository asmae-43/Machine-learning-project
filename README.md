Project Overview

This project involves developing a Streamlit web application for machine learning-based classification and prediction of a person's health status using blood test results. Users can choose between two machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression. The application offers an interactive interface for data exploration, model training, and prediction.

Features

Interactive Data Visualization: Explore the dataset through various visualizations.
Model Training: Choose between K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression for training.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains blood test results for various individuals. Each row represents a person with features such as troponin, Red cells, White cells, anemia, cholesterol, etc., and a target label indicating health status (Healthy/Not Healthy).

Models

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm. It classifies new cases based on similarity measures like distance functions.

Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a linear model for binary classification. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a specific class.

Please note!

The selection of features can significantly impact accuracy and classification metrics due to feature correlations.
